<h1>Assembly x86 Programs</h1>
<p>  This repository is dedicated to my programs made in assembly language (TASM). </p>
<h2>How to Run the files</h2>
<p> Every folder contains the following files:
  <ul>
    <li>The source file (eg. example.asm).</li>
    <li>The .exe file</li>
    <li>Documentation in pdf. These are the instructions on how the program has to work.</li>
</ul>
